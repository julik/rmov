= RMov

Open, edit, and export QuickTime movies all within Ruby! This is an 
unofficial wrapper around Apple's QuickTime C API. Mac OS X required.


== Install

Install the gem:

  gem install rmov

And then load it in your project:

  require 'rmov'


== Usage

Use this gem to open QuickTime movies and edit them to your liking.

  movie1 = QuickTime::Movie.open("path/to/movie.mov")
  movie2 = QuickTime::Movie.open("path/to/another_movie.mov")
  
  # add movie2 to the end of movie1
  movie1.append_movie(movie2)
  
  # make a new movie out of a section of movie 1
  # this will delete 5 seconds out of the movie at 2 seconds in
  movie3 = movie1.clip_section(movie1, 2, 5)
  
  # You can insert that part back into the movie at 8 seconds in
  movie1.insert_movie(movie3, 8)

Now you can export the movie. Usually this is done through a user 
interface the first time around. The settings can then be saved to
a file. After that you can load these settings without interfering
the user with the dialog again.

  exporter = movie1.exporter
  
  # if we already have saved the settings, load those
  if File.exist? "settings.st"
    exporter.load_settings("settings.st")
  else
    # otherwise open the QuickTime GUI settings dialog
    exporter.open_settings_dialog
    
    # save settings to a file so we don't have to bother user next time
    exporter.save_settings("settings.st")
  end
  
  # export the movie to a file and report the progress along the way
  exporter.export("movie.mov") do |progress|
    percent = (progress*100).round
    puts "#{percent}% complete"
  end
