RMov

Ruby wrapper for the QuickTime C API.

This is still in very early development. If you want to try it out, you'll need to run a few commands.

  cd ext
  ruby extconf.rb
  make

That will generate an "rmov.bundle". You can "require" just like any Ruby file.

  require 'rmov'
  movie = Quicktime::Movie.new('foo.mov')
  movie.duration # returns number of seconds of movie

More features coming soon.
