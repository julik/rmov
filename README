RMov

Ruby wrapper for the QuickTime C API.

This is still in very early development. To try it out, run the setup 
task to build the ruby c extensions.

  rake setup

You can then require 'rmov' in the lib directory.

  require 'rmov'
  movie = Quicktime::Movie.open('foo.mov')
  movie.duration # returns number of seconds of movie

More features coming soon.
